<b>Hey There!</b> I see you have stumbled upon the we16 open source project - how very exciting. I'm sure you didn't even know we had one of these. Now that you are here, take a minute to consider contributing to our little open source project - especially if you are attending we16. 

Don't know anything about open source, and how to contribute? Well never fear. We have a handy dandy readme that will take you through all the steps. 

<i>Not so sure</i>, you say? <i>Afraid of breaking things?</i>

That's why we use a review system. If you think you'll break it, we'll be sure to let you know. 

If you'd like to learn more about open source, please attend the session "Navigating the Seas of Open Source Projects" on Friday, October 28th from 4:00pm-5 in PCC, 204B. You'll learn the basics on open source, how open source came to be, what a "community" is, and more!

Don't have time to attend? Well never fear. We'll be posting slides and a "cheat sheet" after the presentation on Friday. They have been master-crafted for viewers like you. 

Any questions? Feel free to contact our support team
