Dear SWE,

I love you with all my heart, but do we have to have more webinars and tweet-chats about “What Not to Wear to the SWE Conference?”

I’ve been a SWE member since 2010, and every year from the beginning of October to the SWE annual conference, we have this same monotonous conversation.


* What should I wear?
* How do I get rid of wrinkles in my clothes during the conference?
* What bag should I bring?
* Do I have to wear makeup?
* What shoes should I wear?
* What would grandma think?
* Is this too Forever21?
....


The SWE annual conference is coming up at the end of the month — which leaves us with a few weeks to go. Let’s start now, to change the conversation for the upcoming conference, and future conferences. Rather than discussing “What Not to Wear,“ let’s shift the conversation to “Sharing Expertise — Travel Hacks for the SWE Conference, or ANY Conference.”
In this post I’ll go over some travel hacks I’ve used over the years to navigate conferences.

<h4>Get used to the fact that you aren’t going to get a lot of (quality) sleep</h4>
<br/>
From the moment you land in the host city, to the moment you leave, you will be meeting new people, shaking a lot of hands, giving a lot of elevator pitches, and going through frequent costume changes. It’s exhausting, and even if you are one of the lucky ones that gets 6–8 hours of sleep, it isn’t going to feel enough. So just in case, make sure you are getting quality sleep the days before the conference.

<h4>Be comfortable in your own skin</h4>
<br/>
Between now and the conference you are going to be bombarded with advice on what not to wear, what to do, what not to do etc etc etc. Having been through my fair share of these events my takeaway is: do what you are comfortable with.

Some of us are comfortable in a pencil skirt, others prefer slacks. Some of us love wearing stiletto heels because looking taller boosts our confidence; others prefer flats. Some of us want a full face of makeup, others don’t know the difference between highlighters, concealers and foundation. My outfit of choice (for a more formal conference) is a pair of khakis/ponte pants, a nice top, a blazer, and a pair of boots.

Tl;dr: You do you! Bring your best self to these events, and rock it out.

<h4>Pack light</h4>
<br/>
In the last 6 years I’ve noticed that companies try to out do each other with the amount of swag they give out. They have transitioned from pens and flyers to portable chargers, socks, and more. Between the conference swag, and career fair swag, you are going to be collecting a bunch of stuff. So make sure you have enough space in your bag to take the good stuff (at minimum) back home with you.
Youtuber Ingrid Nilsen introduced me to packing squares, and they have completely changed my packing game. I got mine from Ikea, but they have some snazzy ones at Target too. For travel in general, I like packing clothes that don’t wrinkle, and are compact. Bonus points for clothes that mix-and-match for outfits that transition from day to night. Check out Ingrid’s video on “How to NOT Overpack Your Suitcase” for more pro-tips (the fragrance atomizer is genius).

<h4>Treat yourself</h4>
<br/>
Conferences are stressful regardless of whether you are looking for a job, presenting, or just attending. There is so much to see and do, and you want to make the most of it. Take a moment relax, and enjoy some of the simple pleasures. Go to a local coffee shop in between sessions, go sightseeing, take a minute to find out if there is a long lost friend you want to meet up with.
