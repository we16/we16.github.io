Lets. Get. Caffinated. 

During a recent trip to Chicago, I was faced with the cold, hard truth: I love Coffee Experiences.

What does that mean? I love the experience of going to local shops, watching the brewers create the perfect cup of coffee. Brewers. Not Baristas. It's a craft, and it's amazing. I've graduated from frappaccinos, and in some cases even cold brew. I love coffee on tap (yes, you read that right), and I'm so beyond enamored by creative combinations like an Iced Espresso Horchata.

So what does Philadelphia have to offer? I'm going to channel my inner Gilmore Girl, and head to these places during we16:

* <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/elixr-coffee-roasters-philadelphia-3">Elixr Coffee</a> - Anything that'll give me latte art! And a cardamom orange donut!
* <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-la-mousse-philadelphia">A La Mousse</a> - Milk foam tea & the Matcha Mousse Cake
* <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/passeros-coffee-roasters-philadelphia-3">Passero's Coffee Roasters</a> - Something with their Bali blend
* <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/qt-vietnamese-sandwich-philadelphia">QT Vietnamese Sandwich</a> - Vietnamese Iced Coffee & a Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mi

Do you like coffee? Or are you more of a tea fan? Neither would be blasphemy. 

If you find the best coffee in Philly, you better let me know
