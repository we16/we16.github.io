It's been a long day. I left Rochester MN at 4:00 this morning to catch my 6:50 flight from MSP PHL. 

Once I landed I took an uber and headed to my AirBNB by the convention center (the sharing economy is a wonderful evil). After changing out of my comfy airplane clothes, I rushed over to the convention center to find my fellow IBMers for lunch. 

We endeded up going to [QT Vietnamese Sandwich](https://www.yelp.com/biz/qt-vietnamese-sandwich-philadelphia) and I got a delicious Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mi, and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (10/10, would go again). After that I went to the afternoon sessions.

Here are some screenshots of the sessions I attended
